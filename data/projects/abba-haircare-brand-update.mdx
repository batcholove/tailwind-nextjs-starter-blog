## Overview

Abba haircare has been a trusted name in professional hair care for decades. While the brand had deep customer loyalty, the visual identity and digital presence felt outdated. This project focused on modernizing the brand while honoring its legacy and heritage.

The challenge was to create a contemporary brand experience that appeals to both long-time customers and a new generation of beauty professionals.

## The Challenge

The brand faced several key challenges:

### Outdated Visual Identity

The existing visual identity didn't reflect the brand's quality or innovation. The color palette, typography, and imagery felt dated compared to contemporary beauty brands.

### Inconsistent Digital Presence

Across packaging, website, and social media, the brand lacked visual consistency and a cohesive narrative.

### Generational Gap

While established customers remained loyal, the brand struggled to appeal to younger beauty professionals and consumers.

## The Approach

We developed a comprehensive brand update that included:

### Visual Identity Modernization

- Updated color palette reflecting natural, professional beauty
- Contemporary typography selection
- Modern iconography and graphic elements
- Refined logo mark maintaining brand recognition

### Packaging Design

- Premium substrate selection
- Functional yet beautiful label design
- Improved hierarchy and information architecture
- Sustainable packaging considerations

### Digital Presence

- Modernized website design
- Social media visual guidelines
- Updated product photography
- Digital brand standards documentation

## Key Outcomes

The brand refresh successfully:

- Increased brand recognition among younger professionals
- Improved shelf presence in retail environments
- Strengthened emotional connection with existing customers
- Created a platform for growth and new product lines
