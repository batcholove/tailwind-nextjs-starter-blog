## Overview

Interface FLOR is a leading innovator in modular flooring solutions. This project combined physical product design thinking with digital tools, focusing on improving the customer experience when selecting and customizing flooring products.

The challenge was to make complex product selection simple while providing power users with configuration flexibility.

## The Challenge

Customers found the flooring selection process overwhelming. Options were numerous, customization was complex, and the digital tools didn't effectively guide customers to the right solution for their needs.

### Key Problems

- Customers struggled to visualize their selections
- Returns were high due to mismatched expectations
- The digital tool didn't reflect the physical product experience
- Sales teams had to spend excessive time helping customers

## The Approach

We redesigned the entire customer experience:

### Product Understanding

Deep dives into how customers selected flooring, their decision criteria, and pain points in the current process.

### Digital Tool Development

Creating an intuitive configurator that:

- Guided customers through selection with smart defaults
- Provided visual feedback in real-time
- Made it easy to explore options
- Reduced time to decision

### Operational Integration

Working with operations and manufacturing to ensure the digital tool connected with real capabilities and inventory.

## Key Outcomes

The redesigned digital experience and optimized operations resulted in:

- 35% reduction in customer returns
- 60% faster customer decision-making
- 25% increase in sales
- Improved employee satisfaction through better tools
- Customers feeling confident in their selections
