## Overview

This project explored how personas and user archetypes become powerful tools for aligning cross-functional teams around human-centered design. By creating shared mental models of users, teams make better product decisions and maintain empathy throughout the design process.

## The Challenge

Many organizations struggle with user research that gets filed away and forgotten. Researchers conduct interviews, but the insights don't inform daily product decisions. Teams make assumptions about users rather than designing from evidence.

### Key Problems

- User research insights weren't accessible to all team members
- Design decisions weren't grounded in user understanding
- Different teams had different mental models of the same user
- Remote work made shared understanding harder to achieve

## The Approach

We developed a comprehensive persona and archetype system that included:

### User Research Foundation

Extensive interviews and research across multiple user segments to identify patterns and create evidence-based personas.

### Persona Development

Creating detailed personas that included:

- Demographics and background
- Goals, motivations, and pain points
- Context of use and workflows
- Decision-making patterns

### Archetype Framework

Building broader archetypes that represented user types across the entire ecosystem, enabling teams to think beyond individual products.

## Key Outcomes

The persona and archetype system resulted in:

- Increased alignment across product, design, and engineering teams
- User-centered decision making becoming the default
- Faster feature validation against user needs
- Improved product satisfaction and user adoption
- Teams referencing personas in daily discussions and decisions
