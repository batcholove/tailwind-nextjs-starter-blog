## Design Systems

Designing consistency, speed, and clarity at scale.

## About the project

Multiple teams and vendors were designing and building products independently. Inconsistencies in UI, interaction patterns, and language created friction for users and inefficiency for teams.

This work focused on creating a shared system that supported quality, reuse, and scalability across products.

## Role

Design System Lead
Component Architect
Design & Dev Liaison

## Focus

Design Systems
Component Libraries
Documentation
Design-Dev Collaboration

## Outcome

Design and development became faster and more consistent. Teams reused patterns instead of reinventing them. Users experienced clearer, more predictable interactions across products. The system scaled across teams, vendors, and platforms.
