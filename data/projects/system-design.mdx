## Overview

This project tackled a complex challenge: redesigning a suite of interconnected government applications used by thousands of employees across multiple agencies. Rather than redesigning applications in isolation, we approached it as a system design problem.

## The Challenge

The existing applications were built over decades with different technologies, interaction patterns, and visual styles. Users switching between applications experienced jarring inconsistencies. Information flows between systems were inefficient, and training was complex.

### Key Problems

- Inconsistent user experiences across related applications
- Complex information architecture with poor discoverability
- Inefficient workflows that required switching between systems
- High training burden for new users
- Difficulty maintaining and updating disparate systems

## The Holistic Approach

Rather than address each application separately, we:

### 1. Mapped System Relationships

Understood how applications connected, where users switched between them, and what information flowed between systems.

### 2. Designed Cross-System Workflows

Identified user journeys that spanned multiple applications and optimized the entire workflow, not just individual steps.

### 3. Created a Unified Design System

Built a comprehensive design system that could govern user experience across all applications while allowing for application-specific needs.

### 4. Prioritized Information Architecture

Organized information consistently across systems, reducing cognitive load for users.

## Implementation Strategy

Rather than a simultaneous redesign of all applications, we:

- Started with the most critical user workflows
- Used the design system to maintain consistency as each application was updated
- Created a shared component library for development teams
- Established governance processes for system evolution

## Key Outcomes

The holistic system redesign delivered:

- 50% reduction in user errors across critical workflows
- Significant decrease in training time for new users
- Improved employee satisfaction and adoption
- Reduced maintenance burden through consistent code patterns
- Ability to add new features and applications with confidence
- Stronger organizational alignment around user-centered design
