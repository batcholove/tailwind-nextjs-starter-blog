## Overview

This project is a testament to the universal principles of design. While focused on physical spaces and installations, the approach, methodology, and thinking apply equally to digital design. Strong design fundamentals transcend discipline.

## The Philosophy

Good design solves problems. Whether designing a user interface, a physical space, or a branded installation, the core principles remain consistent:

- **User-centered thinking**: Understanding who uses the space and why
- **Problem identification**: Defining the real challenges to solve
- **Strategic thinking**: Considering the broader context and goals
- **Thoughtful execution**: Paying attention to details that matter
- **Iteration and refinement**: Testing assumptions and improving based on feedback
