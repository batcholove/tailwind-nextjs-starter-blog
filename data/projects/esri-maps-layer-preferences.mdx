## Overview

This project centered on redesigning how users interact with geographic data and map layers in a sophisticated mapping application. The challenge was to make complex layer management intuitive while maintaining power-user functionality.

## The Challenge

Users struggled with layer management in traditional map interfaces. The existing solution was feature-rich but confusing, leading to user frustration and reduced adoption of key capabilities.

### Key Problems

- Layer organization became chaotic with many layers active
- Users had difficulty understanding layer relationships
- Toggling visibility was cumbersome
- Layer properties were buried in nested menus

## The Approach

We conducted extensive user research to understand:

### User Mental Models

Understanding how users conceptualized layers and data relationships informed our design direction.

### User Research Findings

/>

### Design Solution

We reimagined the layer preferences interface with:

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive layer organization
- Quick-access visibility toggles
- Contextual layer properties

### Implementation Details

As we refined the design, we focused on several critical improvements:

**Layer Actions & Updates**

**Advanced Language Mapping**

We created multiple language mapping approaches for complex geospatial relationships:

**Search & Sort Capabilities**

Implementing efficient search and sorting mechanisms:

**Side Drawer Updates**

Enhanced side drawer with improved layout and interactions:

/>

**Basemap Selection**

Integrated basemap selection directly into the layer management interface:

## Key Outcomes

The redesigned interface resulted in:

- 45% increase in layer management interactions
- Improved user satisfaction scores
- Faster workflow completion times
- Increased adoption of advanced features
