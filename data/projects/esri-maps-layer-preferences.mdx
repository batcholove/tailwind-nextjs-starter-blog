## Simplifying complex tools through clear language and familiar patterns

Mapping tools were powerful but difficult to use. Legacy patterns, dense terminology, and limited flexibility created friction for both new and experienced users. This work focused on redesigning a critical part of the mapping experience so it aligned with how users think, speak, and work.

### Role

- Senior Product Designer
- UX and UI designer
- UX writing contributor
- User Researcher

### Focus

- Complex Mapping Applications
- Applied design systems
- Interaction design
- UX writing and language

### Outcome

The experience became easier to understand, faster to use, and easier to teach. Language was simplified. Interactions aligned with familiar patterns. New capabilities were introduced without increasing cognitive load.

## The Challenge

Users struggled with layer management in traditional map interfaces. The existing solution was feature-rich but confusing, leading to user frustration and reduced adoption of key capabilities.

### Key Problems

- Layer organization became chaotic with many layers active
- Users had difficulty understanding layer relationships
- Toggling visibility was cumbersome
- Layer properties were buried in nested menus

## The Approach

We conducted extensive user research to understand:

### User Mental Models

Understanding how users conceptualized layers and data relationships informed our design direction.

### Design Solution

We reimagined the layer preferences interface with:

- Clear visual hierarchy
- Intuitive layer organization
- Quick-access visibility toggles
- Contextual layer properties

### Implementation Details

As we refined the design, we focused on several critical improvements:

**Layer Actions & Updates**

**Data Structure Mapping**

**Advanced Language Mapping**

We created multiple language mapping approaches for complex geospatial relationships:

**Search & Sort Capabilities**

Implementing efficient search and sorting mechanisms:

/>

**Side Drawer Updates**

Enhanced side drawer with improved layout and interactions:

/>

**Basemap Selection**

Integrated basemap selection directly into the layer management interface:

## Key Outcomes

The redesigned interface resulted in:

- 45% increase in layer management interactions
- Improved user satisfaction scores
- Faster workflow completion times
- Increased adoption of advanced features
